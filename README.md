# VBA-challenge
This challenge definitely felt like one of the tougher challenges to tackle in the course. The skillset needed for VBA feels drastically different than the skillset needed for other languages. When putting together my final code I found it easiest to seperate everything into easy to digest parts. I started with setting the variables and titles BEFORE the for loop. From there, I satisfied each of the project requirements within the loop. It took a lot of shifting around to finally get everything in the right place. I am relieved to have this completed challenge under my belt!
